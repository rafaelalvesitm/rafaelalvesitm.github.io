## Aims & Scope

_Information Processing in Agriculture_ (IPA) was established in 2013 to encourage the development of science and technology related to information processing in agriculture, through the following aims:  
- Promote the use of knowledge and methods from information processing technologies in agriculture;  
- Report on experiences and publications of institutes, universities, and government, as well as profitable technologies for agriculture;  
- Provide a platform and opportunities for exchanging knowledge, strategies, and experiences among information processing researchers worldwide;  
- Promote and encourage interactions among agriculture scientists, meteorologists, biologists (pathologists/entomologists), information technology professionals, and other stakeholders to develop and implement methods, techniques, and tools related to information processing technology in agriculture;  
- Create and promote expert groups for the development of agro-meteorological databases, crop and livestock modeling, and applications for the development of crop performance-based decision support systems.  
  
**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects:**  

- Smart sensors, biosensors and bioelectronics, material and molecular innovations for chemical and biological sensing, sensors, and automation and control systems for agriculture;  
- Wireless sensor networks, 4G, NB-IOT, and 5G applications in agriculture;  
- Remote sensing and discrete element modeling (DEM) applications in agriculture;  
- Simulation, optimization, modeling, and automated control;  
- Decision support systems, intelligent systems, and artificial intelligence;  
- Machine vision, computer vision, image processing and automation, and imaging technologies for high-throughput phenotyping  
- Advances in spectroscopy and hyperspectral properties of biological products;  
- Advanced computational approaches for solving agricultural and biological engineering problems;  
- Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications in agriculture;  
- Inspection and traceability for food quality;  
- Precision agriculture, intelligent instruments, robotics, and co-robotics for agriculture;  
- Internet of things, cloud computing, and precision farming;  
- Big data, data mining, and data analysis for agricultural applications;  
- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for sensing, imaging, and agricultural aquacultural applications.
